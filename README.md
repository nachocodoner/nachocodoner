## Hey there, welcome!

I'm Nacho Codoñer.

💻 I'm a **software engineer** passionate about building **multiplatform apps** using **web technologies only**, centered around **JavaScript**. I work across the full stack: frontend, backend, testing, and infrastructure. I'm particularly _obsessed with the Meteor framework_, for its simplicity, power, and the passionate community of developers behind it.

🚀 I'm currently helping **modernize the Meteor framework** so that any professional or company can rely on it for modern multiplatform development. To support that, I **contribute part-time to the Meteor core team**, and also independently as an enthusiastic hobbyist.

🤝 I enjoy collaborating with **teams** that value **proactivity**, **fun**, **learn and experimentation**, **automation**, **horizontal collaboration**, **long-term thinking**, and **respect for each person’s independence and decisions**.

🌱 I love **indie development** and deeply value **autonomy**. I enjoy a calm, focused work rhythm, space for deep thinking, and the freedom to build with intention. In my spare time, I express creativity by building my _own dream apps_.

🏡 Outside tech, I enjoy quiet plans at home, spending time outside with friends and family, running, and playing and exploring the mechanics of board games and online video games.
